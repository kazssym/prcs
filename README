	       PRCS -- Project Revision Control System


Announcing version 1.3.0 of PRCS, the Project Revision Control
System.  PRCS is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS)
provide a way to deal with sets of files and directories as an entity,
preserving coherent versions of the entire set.

PRCS was designed primarily by Professor P. N. Hilfinger, with input
and modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Joshua MacDonald.  PRCS is
written and maintained by Joshua MacDonald.

Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according
to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those
systems.

To compile and install PRCS, read the instructions in the INSTALL
file.  Once you have done this, you should at least read the first few
sections of the documentation.  It is available in info format.  All
documentation is located in the doc/ subdirectory.

The current release, version 1.3.0, future releases of PRCS, HTML
documentation and recent developments are available online at

   http://prcs.xdelta.org

PRCS is released under the GNU public license, see the file COPYING
for details.

A mailing list has been formed for announcements and discussion:

   prcs-list@XCF.Berkeley.EDU,

you can subscribe by sending an empty message to

    prcs-list-subscribe@XCF.Berkeley.EDU

and you can unsubscribe by sending an empty message to

    prcs-list-unsubscribe@XCF.Berkeley.EDU

Comments about PRCS can be addressed to the following addresses:

   prcs@XCF.Berkeley.EDU

Bug reports can be addressed to the following address:

   prcs-bugs@XCF.Berkeley.EDU

When sending bug reports, always include:
-- a complete description of the problem encountered
-- the output of `prcs config'
-- the operating system and version
-- the architecture.

If possible, include:
-- the file `/tmp/prcs_bug', if it exists
-- the working project file, if one was in use
-- the output of `ls -lR' in the current directory.

Disk space permitting, retain the following:
-- any relevant working project files
-- a repository package created with `prcs package PROJECT'.

Disk space not permitting, retain just:
-- the repository file PRCS/PROJECT/PROJECT.prj,v
-- the repository log PRCS/PROJECT/prcs_log
-- the repository data file PRCS/PROJECT/prcs_data
-- the output of `rlog' on each repository file under PRCS/PROJECT.

These steps will help diagnose the problem.
