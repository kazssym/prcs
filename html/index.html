<h3>
What is PRCS?</h3>

<blockquote>PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end
to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files
and directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire
set.&nbsp; PRCS was designed primarily by Paul N. Hilfinger, with input
and modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Joshua MacDonald. PRCS is written
and maintained by Joshua MacDonald.&nbsp; Its purpose is similar to that
of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according to its authors, at least), it is
much simpler than any of those systems.&nbsp; This page is where information
on the latest developments in PRCS can be found. The current release of
PRCS is 1.3.0.&nbsp; Version 1.0 was released on September 3, 1996.</blockquote>

<h3>
Development Status</h3>

<blockquote>The second major version of PRCS (PRCS2) has been under
development since early 1997, when I began a project that aims to
replace RCS as a back-end storage manager.&nbsp; The primary goal of
version 2 is to add client/server support.&nbsp; The first milestone
that was reached towards this end is <a
href="http://www.xdelta.org">Xdelta</a>, a new delta compression algorithm
for PRCS2 based on the <a href="http://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a>
algorithm.&nbsp; The second milestone has been reached, a new storage
manager based on <a href="http://www.xdelta.org">Xdelta</a>.
