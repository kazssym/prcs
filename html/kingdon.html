<h1>CVS Comparisons</h1>

4 thoughts from Jim Kingdon (CVS maintainer, author of client/server
support for CVS).

<ul>
<li>  PRCS has separate metadata and atomic checkins.  This is
definately a nice feature, that we would like to add to CVS (when
someone gets around to it).
<P>
</li>
<P>
<li> Using PRCS involves editing text files more so than CVS, which
performs similar operations from the command line (most of the time).
This could be a bug or a feature depending on one's point of view.

<P>
</li>
<P>
<li>
    CVS has a client/server implementation and PRCS does not.
    <P>

    </li>
    <P>
    <li>

  CVS is better at letting you work on either an entire directory
tree or one portion thereof.  The PRCS documentation talks about
subprojects, but it doesn't have the ability to operate on a project
and all its subprojects in one operation.
<P>
	</li>
</ul>
