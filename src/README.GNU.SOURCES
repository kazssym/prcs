The GNU sources in this directory, getopt and regex, have all been
slightly modified.

The getopt sources in this directory ARE MODIFIED from the GNU getopt
sources.  They handle "--" differently.  As a result, these source
files no longer have the __GNU_LIBRARY__ logic.

The regex modifications are to rename all symbols, preventing any
possible confusion.  Taken from glibc-2.2.4.

The version of gperf used to generate prcs-keys.c and prj-names.h is
my own, I had to modify it somewhat.
