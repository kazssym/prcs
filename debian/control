Description: The Project Revision Control System
 PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to a set
 of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files and
 directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire
 set.
 .
 Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according
 to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those
 systems.
 .
 Emacs-Lisp support is distributed in a separate package, prcs-el.  Another
 package called prcs-synch contains a tool to synchronize PRCS projects
 between repositories, both locallly and remotely.
 .

Description: ELisp support for the Project Revision Control System
 This package contains Emacs-Lisp add-on support for PRCS, the Project
 Revision Control System.  It provides a useful interface for some
 PRCS commands (checkin, diff, info, and rekey) while editing project
 descriptor files (.prj).
 .
 prcs-el is distributed separately from the prcs package because it depends 
 on Emacs (or another "emacsen" flavor).

Description: Synchronize PRCS projects between repositories
 The prcs-synch tries to synchronize two PRCS (Project Revision Control
 System) repositories. It requires a "remote" repository, which is assumed
 to have recent changes, vs. a "local" repository which is out of date.
 .
 prcs-synch is distributed separately from the prcs package because it
 depends on perl5.
