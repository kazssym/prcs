prcs (1.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-VErsion to 3.6.1 (no changes needed).
    - Build-Depend on dpatch.
  * debian/rules:
    - Removed call to make patch-stamp and the Debian specific patches 
      rebuild.cc-patch and prcserror.cc-patch (applied upstream).
    - Added dpatch support for the Debian patches in the contrib dir that
      used to be in the diff.gz file.

prcs (1.3.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/prcs-el.files: Added manpages files, which used to be delcared
    ion debian/prcs-el.manpages.  After the regeneration of
    doc/Makefile.in with automake, these files got installed in
    debian/tmp, ending up in package prcs.  This caused an upgrade error
    for the prcs package.
  * debian/prcs-el.mapages: Removed file.

prcs (1.3.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Regenerate autotools files by running aclocal, automake, and
    autoconf, such that file /usr/share/info/dir.gz is not included in the
    package (closes: #220955).
  * debian/rules: Remove files config.sub and config.guess in target
    clean.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Nov 2003 17:08:04 +0100

prcs (1.3.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/Makefile.in: Redirect stderr to stdout in command "install-info
    --version", such that the package will build correctly with any
    version of install-info.  Thanks to Andreas Metzler
    <ametzler@logic.univie.ac.at> for the patch (closes: #219970).

prcs (1.3.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Apply patches for compilation g++ 3.3.  The patch files are
      debian/{rebuild,prcserror}.cc-patch.
    - Added autotools-stamp rule for copying config.guess and config.sub
      from the autotools-dev package.
  * debian/control:
    - Added autotools-dev to Build-Depends.
    - In the Description field, use the style "Homepage: http://[...]" as
      advised by the Best Packaging Practices manual.
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.9.

prcs (1.3.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Changed dependency of prcs-synch on textutils to
    coreutils (closes: #163452).

prcs (1.3.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Added upstream file prcs-ediff.el to the prcs-el
    package.  It was being foolishly removed, what prevented the
    prcs-ediff command to work properly (closes: #156969).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Aug 2002 15:45:35 +0200

prcs (1.3.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * contrib/visualtree/prcs_tree_info.pl: Applied patch from Yann Dirson
    <dirson@debian.org> to fix edge coloring (closes: #150372).
  * contrib/visualtree/prcs-show-tree: Added file.  Contributed by Yann
    Dirson <dirson@debian.org> (closes: #150373).
  * contrib/visualtree/prcs-show-tree.1: Added file.

    - Fixed call to xvcg in synopsis.
    - Added documentation for prcs-show-tree.
    - Added names of the authors.

prcs (1.3.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added docbook-utils to Build-Depends (closes: #146744).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 12 May 2002 22:00:09 +0200

prcs (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  There has been a total reorganisation of the
    contrib dir, done upstream by myself.  All the files that used to
    be in debian/man have been moved elsewhere.  Many changes to the
    files debian/*.{files, odcs,manpages} due to the overhaul. Also, the
    prcsstatus script in the prcs-utils package does not die anymore when
    PRCS_REPOSITORY is unset (closes: #144568).
  * debian/doc-base: Contains now the doc-base entry for the HTML version
    of the manual.
  * debian/doc-base.prcs-tutorial: Renamed from debian/doc-base.
  * debian/man/prcs-utils.sgml: Added file, contributed by Yann Dirson
    <dirson@debian.org>, with fixed typos (closes: #144580) and better
    synopsis.  I also added the synopsis for the new scripts contributed
    by Yann (in contrib/).
  * debian/prcs-utils.files: Added files from Yann's suite.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install files from Yann's suite.
    - Call configure with --diable-lex-check.
    - Build HTML files from texinfo documentation (closes: #144567).
    - Removed auto-patching when usign gcc v3.x.  This is done
      automatically by the upstream Makefile now.
    - Install contrib/bash-completion script.
    - Build the prcs-utils manpage from the sgml source.
  * debian/docs: Added debian/html directory.
  * debian/control: Removed flex and added texinfo and docbook-utils to
    Build-Depends.  Upgraded dependency of prcs-synch on ssh from Suggests
    to Recommends, since ssh is no more in non-us now.  Since some scripts
    have been moved from the prcs into the prcs-utils package, prcs-utils
    conflicts with prcs << 1.3.2-1.
  * debian/prcs-utils.manpages: Added man pages for Yann's suite.
  * debian/dirs: Added etc/bash_completion.d directory.
  * debian/conffiles: Added file.
  * debian/prcs-utils.copyright: Added Yann Dirson and Austin Donnelly
    to the list of upstream authors.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 12 May 2002 14:41:18 +0200

prcs (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Help messages (prcs --help) are now sent to stdout instead of stderr
      (closes: #88725).
    - prcs-clean can now remove symlinks, directories (applied patch from
      Steve Dodd <steved@loth.demon.co.uk>, closes: #65798)
  * debian/rules: Test for hppa architecture or verion  >= 3.0 of gcc and
    apply the patch debian/prcs1.3.1gcc3.diffs (provided by the upstream
    author).  There is now a target called "patch".  The "clean" reverts
    the patch, all being controlled by the presence of the "patch-stamp"
    file.  This should close a release critical bug against prcs,
    which was not compilable at the hppa architecture (closes: #104705).
  * src/dstrings, configure: Changes to make it compile for the hppa
    architecture.  I hope that these cahnges will be integrated upstream.
  * debian/control: Added patch to Build-Depends.
  * debian/man/: Added newline to the end of several files in this
    directory.  This avoids warnings that are emitted when generating the
    .diff.gz file.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Feb 2002 19:48:08 +0100

prcs (1.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added dependency to real Emacsen to the prcs-el
    package.  The packages are now lintian-clean.  Fixed also the URL for
    the PRCS location (now at SourceForge).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Feb 2002 11:02:41 +0100

prcs (1.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Fixed spelling errors in package description (thanks
    to Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>, closes: #125268).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Dec 2001 17:17:10 +0100

prcs (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Downgraded ssh dependency of prcs-synch from Recommends to Suggests.
    This way, prcs-synch does not need to go into non-US, and there is no
    need to split the source package. (Really closes: #109405.)
  * Make sure that it closes: #113207.  See below.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Oct 2001 12:33:42 +0100

prcs (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version: 3.5.6.
  * debian/control:
    - Change dependencies from the transitional "perl-5.005" and
      "perl-5.6" packages to "perl" (closes: #113207).
    - prcs-synch is moved into non-US, due to the recommendation on
      ssh. (closes: #109405).
    - Added versioned dependencies on debhelper and textutils.
  * The PRCS contributed software is now in contrib/ (it used to be in
    scripts/).  The debian/rules file has been modified accordingly.  In
    particular, a new variable called contribdir is created.  Also,
    debian/docs reflects now the new situation.
  * debian/rules:
    - Removed call to dh_testversion.
    - Removed unnecessary settings of CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS in the call of
      make.
  * debian/prerm: Renamed from debian/postrm, due to the lintian
    warnign that install-info should be called from the prerm script.
  * debian/*copyright: Updated download URL.
  * Added new package prcs-visualtree.
  * Updated man pages for prcs-ediff, prcs-emerge, prcs-synch, and
    prcs-visualtree.1 (in debian/man/).

prcs (1.2.15-11.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Removed diff, tar, fileutils, and gzip from
    Build-Depends, since these packages are build-essential.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 29 Mar 2001 13:30:01 +0200

prcs (1.2.15-11.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched prcs.el to avoid bug when loading project descriptors
    containing files whose name start with a period.  Thanks to Jiri Masik
    <masik@pc203b.fzu.cz> and Jesse Glick <Jesse.Glick@netbeans.com>
    (closes: #90497).
  * Added ".potato.1" to Debian release number to indicate that this
    version of the package works also in Debian potato (2.2).  Before
    woody comes out, there will be a new release 1.2.15-12 (I hope).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 29 Mar 2001 08:56:43 +0200

prcs (1.2.15-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Fixed typo in Build-Depends.  Thanks to Philip
    Blundell <philb@gnu.org> (closes: #90413).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 20 Mar 2001 11:59:07 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added rcs to Build-Depends, otherwise the prcs
    executable get wrong hardcoded paths for the rcs commands (co, ci,
    rcs, rlog).  Added also diff, tar, fileutils, and gzip to
    Build-Depends for the same reason (correct paths for diff, diff3,
    tar, ls, and gzip).  Thanks to Jiri Masik <masik@pc203b.fzu.cz>
    (closes: #90247).
  * debian/control: Fixed some typos and improved package descriptions.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 19 Mar 2001 15:30:13 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added flex to Build-Depends.  Thanks to Michael
    Schmitz <schmitz@zirkon.biophys.uni-duesseldorf.de> (closes: #89746).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Fri, 16 Mar 2001 09:43:24 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added Perl dependencies to the prcs-synch package.
    Added also dependency on textutils (for the tsort command) and
    recommendation on ssh.  ssh is only needed for synchronizing remote
    repositories,  prcs-synch can also be used for synchronization of two
    local repositories.  Fixed also Perl 5.6 dependency in Build-Depends.
  * debian/rules: Added call to dh_perl.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 17:54:52 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Install man page of prcs-javadoc command into section 1,
    since it is a regular user command.  Thanks to Yann Dirson
    <dirson@debian.org> (closes: #89485).
  * debian/control: Added Build-Depends.
  * debian/prcs-synch.copyright: Inserted the complete copyright notice
    present in scripts/prcs-synch.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 17:04:45 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a debian/preinst file to delete the Emacs startup file
    (50prcs.el) that caused problems when upgrading a slink box to potato.
    Closes: #58648.  It is a simple fix, worth to go into potato.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 10 Apr 2000 14:23:46 +0200

prcs (1.2.15-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new emacs support files by Jesse Glick <jesse.glick@netbeans.com>
    that fixes the problem of reading project descriptor files with
    file names containing the "#" character.  Closes: #53948.

  * [To the Release Manager] Why this should go into frozen: there is no
    new code or new feature added, only a 20 lines patch to fix a nasty
    related to the emacs add-on package.  This only improves potato,
    without adding no new bug.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 28 Mar 2000 12:36:44 +0200

prcs (1.2.15-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/post{inst,rm}: Removed bogus "exit 0", just before
    #DEBHELPER#.  This was preventing the prcs package from being really
    FHS compliant.
  * debian/doc-base: Added support for doc-base for proper registration of
    Rafael Kitover's PRCS tutorial.
  * I also realized that version 1.2.15-3 has never been uploaded.
  * [To the Release Manager: there is no new code, no new features, only
    better integration with the Debian system.]

prcs (1.2.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created separated copyright files for prcs-el and prcs-synch
    packages.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 14 Dec 1999 10:21:40 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created a new binary package for prcs-synch: Lintian was complaining
    about a needed dependency to perl5.  I think it is worth to move
    prcs-synch outside, in order to avoid making the whole prcs package
    dependent on perl5.
  * Fixed typo in debian/control.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version: 3.1.1.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 14 Dec 1999 10:02:16 +0100

prcs (1.2.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Closes: #49349.
  * debian/prcs-el.files: Sanitized non-FHS entries.
  * debian/docs: Removed {ANNOUNCE,README}.xdelta, which are not
    distributed anymore.
  * debian/{postinst,prerm,postrm}: Oops, these files were not really FHS
    compliant...
  * debian/prcs-el.{postinst,prerm}: Removed, as debhelper takes care of
    everything here.
  * debian/rules:
    - Test for debhelper version >= 2.0.72.
    - Correct dirs for installing man and info docs.
    - Generate man page for prcs-synch (using pod2man).
    - Inverting order of call of "install" and "fix-perl-path.pl" when
      installing Perl scripts.  This should avoid spurious diffs being
      included in the Debian diff.gz file.
  * debian/prcs-tutorial.html: Added file.  (Written by Rafael Kitover
    <caelum@debian.org>.)
  * debian/copyright: Added upstream author name and copyright statement
    for prcs-tutorial.html.
  * New scripts included in the package: rprcs, prcs-javadoc, prcs-synch.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 15 Nov 1999 00:53:09 +0100

prcs (1.2.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled with the latest potato libraries.
  * FHS compliant.

prcs (1.2.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild with version 1.2.74 of debhelper, for which the emacsen
    startup file is correctly named prcs-el.emacsen-startup.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Fri,  4 Jun 1999 12:43:04 +0200

prcs (1.2.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: bug #38820).
  * The new version of prcs.el (1.60) installs the PRCS menu in the
    menubar of XEmacs only if the current buffer is in prcs-mode
    (closes: bug #32208).
  * Fixed bashism in debian/prcs-el.emacsen-install, thanks to Zack
    Weinberg <zack@rabi.columbia.edu> (closes: bug #35403, bug#37347).
  * Radical changes in the Emacs Lisp startup file, which was severely
    broken (closes: bug #35324, bug #35442, bug #37793).
  * Split the package into prcs and prcs-el, the latter containing the
    ELisp support files.  prcs-el  depends on emacs.
  * Compilation of Emacs-Lisp files is now totally prevented during
    package building.
  * Included several scripts under the script/ directory of the upstream
    distribution (diff-command, merge-command, prcs-callback, prcs-ediff,
    and prcs-emerge).  Man pages have been written, for Policy compliance.
  * Made /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50prcs-el.el a conffile for the prcs-el
    package.
  * Added documentation files ANNOUNCE.xdelta, README.xdelta, and Y2K.
  * Removed file debian/README.

  * Integrated new upstream version of prcs.el (fixes Bug#30473, severity

  * debian/rules: delete Emacs Lisp, byte-compiled files in lispdir.
    Changed also emacs/Makefile.in to avoid unnecessary byte-compilations.
  * Recompiled with new release of libc6 (cf discussion in debian-devel
    starting at
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9812/msg00998.html).
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 2.5.0.0

    instead of `debian-emacs-flavor'.  (Fixes Bug#29828, reported by Carl
    R. Witty <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>.)
  * For emacsen install, set the right option `-no-site-file' for Xemacsen
    and `--no-site-file' for Emacsen (this is related to Bug#29823,
    reported by Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <gaia@iki.fi>).

prcs (1.2.11-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU for slink, new upstream version with only bug fixes. Fix Bug#28667.
  * Keep specific emacs fixes from the previous version (Rafael Laboissiere).
  * Add missing usr/bin to debian/dirs.
  * Configure with --disable-environment to avoid accidental pollution of
    the installed package by the packager's environment.
  * Install using $DESTDIR instead of overloading $prefix. Install EMACS
    specific files directly into the right directory and allow binary builds
    of this package even when no emacs flavour is installed.

  * Added prcs-startup.el and put it into /etc/emacs/init.d, in accordance
    with the Debian Emacs Policy for packages with add-on support (see item
    5 of /usr/doc/emacsen-common/debian-emacs-policy.gz).
  * Also in accordance with the Debian Emacs Policy, ELisp files should be
    byte-compiled at install time, using the mechanism of
    emacs-package-install (see item 6 of
    /usr/doc/emacsen-common/debian-emacs-policy.gz).
  * Applied my own patch to emacs/prcs.el for XEmacs 20.4 compatibility.
    I sent the patch to the author (Jesse Glick <jglick@sig.bsh.com>).
  * Added a debian/dirs file to help creating the directories for the
    ELisp files.
  * Added debian/prerm file for purging byte-compiled ELisp files after
    package removal.
  * The five last entries fix Bug#28466.
  * debian/control: Added dependency on rcs (fixes Bug#24801).
  * The .diff.gz file will no more contain files `confdefs.h' and
    `config.log' at the upstream directory, as these are files generated
    by configure.  This was the case for version 1.2.9-0 (maybe something
    was wrong with the clean target?)
