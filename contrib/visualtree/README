Some useful PRCS utilities.  Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>.  PRCS is
a source control system, ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/prcs.

prcs_checkfiles         Compares the files and directories in a project
                        against the .prj file.  Useful to verify that
                        the ignore list is not too broad.

prcs_tree.pl            Read the output from prcs info -l and generate
                        input to xvcg to visualize the graph.  vcg is at
                        ftp://ftp.cs.uni-sb.de/pub/graphics/vcg/vcg.1.30.r3.17.tgz.

prcs_tree_draw          Quick and dirty shell script which takes a
                        project name, optional start and end version
                        numbers, extracts the prcs info -l data, runs
                        prcs_tree.pl and calls xvcg on the result.
