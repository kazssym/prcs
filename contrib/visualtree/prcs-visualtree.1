.SH NAME
prcs_tree_info prcs_tree_draw  \- utilities for visualizing PRCS trees as
graphs 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B prcs info -l
.RI [ project ]
.B | prcs_tree_info | xvcg -
.br
.B prcs_tree_draw
.RI " project"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B prcs-visualtree
suite.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original programs do not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBprcs_tree\fP and \fBprcs_tree2\fP read the output from "prcs info
-l project" and plot the relationship between versions.  Output is commands
for "VCG tool - visualization of compiler graphs" by Iris Lemke, Georg
Sander, and the Compare Consortium. 
.PP
It is possible to use different branches to check how they depend
on each other.  This example assumes a couple of branches starting
with 'EDS', a couple of branches starting with 'HC', asks info
and feeds the output to xvcg.  Versions that are merged into the
'EDS*' or 'HC*', have a single node to show this, but don't have
any node information.

\&      ( prcs info -l --plain-format -r "EDS*" genesis.prj \\
\&        && prcs info -l --plain-format -r "HC*" genesis.prj ) \\
\&      | prcs_tree_info | xvcg -
.Ve
The info1 field of the nodes is used for the version logs.
Perhaps the info2 field could be used for date.
.PP
\fBprcs_tree_draw\fP is a quick and dirty shell script which takes a
project name, optional start and end version numbers, extracts the prcs
info -l data, runs prcs_tree and calls xvcg on the result.
