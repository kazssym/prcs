Here are a couple of tools to help dealing with file renamings.  I
wrote them quickly, they're not feature-complete yet, and lack a
couple of safety checks, but I used them successfully to migrate a
small project into PRCS, and I hope they can serve as a base for
better tools.

In short: an everyday-use tool to rename without having to perform
manual error-prone editting of prj file, and an name-on-import-helper,
in the spirit of what bitkeeper provides.

All this is tty-based.  Maybe I'll try some day to make a perl-gtk gui
to make things even more usable.

All this is covered by the GNU GPL, version 2, although there's no
copyright notice yet in the files.

SYNOPSYS

        prcs-mv <src> <dst>
                Renames <src> into <dst>, both in the filesystem and
                in the prj file (that's for everyday work)

        prcs-mv -p <src> <dst>
                The same, but only impact prj file, and don't check
                anything in the filesystem (used by prcs-assist-move,
                usable manually for renamings that can't be guessed)

        prcs-what-may-move
                Prints on stdout the list of files that are candidates
                for renaming (those that would be ADDED or DELETED by
                "prcs populate -d") in a format suitable as input for...
        prcs-ttyask-move <file1> <file2>
                Takes from <file1> a list of candidate files for
                renaming, attempts to match them based on their
                filenames (that is, only catch dir-hierarchy reorgs),
                and asks the user what to do with matches (using perl
                Term::Readline).  Records those renamings in <file2>
                along with unchanged lines.

        prcs-assist-move
                Runs prcs-ttyask-move on prcs-what-may-move output,
                then "prcs-mv -p" on the files the user specified as
                renames.
