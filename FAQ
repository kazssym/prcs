Here are some frequently asked questions:

======================================================================

PRCS prints something like the following, it can happen anytime, not
just at initial checkout (which is often when people discover this).

$ prcs command P
prcs: Cannot determine project name, there must be a single project
      file in the directory `P'.
$

The problem is described in the "Naming Projects" section of the
documentation.  Basically, you can name a project by giving the
directory in which it resides.  You can also name a project by its
name, or by the name of its project file.  If you leave off the
project name argument, "." is defaulted.  There are then three ways to
determine the name, given in the order of precedence:

1. If the name is of the form P.prj or D/P.prj, the project is assumed
to be P, optionally in the directory D.

2. If the name is of the form D and D is a directory, it looks for a
unique project file in the directory D.  This handles the default
case.

3. Otherwise, the name is of the form P or D/P, it assumes the name of
the project is P, optionally in the directory D.

So, in the above example, replace P with P.prj, and it will succeed.

======================================================================

At checkin, PRCS prints out something like:

prcs: RCS failed on file /home/user/PRCS/P/13_overview.P,v
rcs error: unknown option: -T
rcs usage: rcs -{ae}logins -Afile -{blu}[rev] ...
rcs aborted

Your version of RCS is too old, you need GNU RCS 5.7, PRCS does not
work with older versions.  You can use the same binary by setting the
RCS_PATH environment variable.  You can check that your version of RCS
is up to date without running checkin, by running 'prcs config', which
reports the values of all environment variables and compiled in
settings.

======================================================================

I try to do something with a binary which I did not compile and it
complains about not being able to find one of the binaries that was
compiled in.  For example:

$  prcs package P P.pkg
prcs: System command `/usr/sww/bin/GNU/tar' does not exist.
prcs: Command failed.

To fix this, set RCS_PATH to a colon-separated list of directories in
which PRCS should look and run the 'prcs config' command to see that
everything is okay.

======================================================================

You experience the following:

$ prcs checkin -l
prcs: Checking in project `P' version 0.2.
.../PRCS/P/8_P.o,v  <--  .../PRCS/P/8_P.o
new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1
Binary files /tmp/da001ND and /tmp/T2a001N7 differ
ci: .../PRCS/P/8_P.o,v: diff failed
ci aborted
prcs: RCS ci failed on batch command.
prcs: Command failed.
$

Your version of RCS was not configured to use GNU diff, and therefore
it cannot handle binary files.  Rebuild RCS with its diff path set to
a GNU version of diff.
