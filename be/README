This directory holds various files needed to fully configure PRCS for
the BeOS platform.

  Makefile-Gen-Std.diff:
    The diff between the src/Makefile as generated by configure, and
    the actually useful Makefile.

  Makefile-Std:
    The full src/Makefile as it is needed.

  Makefile-Gen-Be.diff
    The diff between the src/Makefile as generated by configure and
    the actually useful Makefile with added cross-compiling ability.

  Makefile-Be:
    The full src/Makefile with cross-compiling ability.

  Makefile-Be.inc:
    A set of macros used by Makefile-Be via inclusion. This separation
    keeps the differences between the generated Makefile and Makefile-Be
    small(er).
