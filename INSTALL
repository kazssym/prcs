Everyone should read the first and last section, read 2 or 3 depending
on whether you are compiling PRCS for yourself or using a precompiled
binary.

0. Remember to read the FAQ before asking questions if something fails!

1. Things both binary and source distributions need:

You need RCS version 5.7 installed.  If 'rcs -V' fails, then you don't
have the version 5.7.  PRCS is known to fail with previous versions of
RCS.  RCS must be properly configured!  If your version of RCS has been
configured to use the manufacturer's diff and diff3 programs, PRCS
and RCS will not be able to handle binary files.

You need the programs tar, gzip, and the GNU versions of diff and diff3.
These can be obtained in the GNU diffutils package, and are the same
that RCS needs to operate properly on binary files, so you might as
well insure that RCS is using them when configuring PRCS.

2. How to install PRCS from a binary distribution:

Simply install the binary somewhere, set RCS_PATH to a colon separated
list of directories containing the executables

************ NOTE ************

Run `prcs config' to see that the compiled-in command-paths are
correct.  If 'prcs config' reports an error, check RCS_PATH or the
version of RCS (rcs -V) or the version of diff (diff -v).

3. How to install PRCS from a source distribution:

The configure argument --prefix lets you specify where PRCS is to be
installed.  The default installation prefix is /usr/local/lib.

If you are using g++, you will need to tell `configure' where the
libg++ libraries and include files are installed, using the
environment variable LIBGPLUSPLUS.  If it is not set, `configure' will
assume that g++'s default path is correct.  If the compiler's default
path does not include the lex or flex libraries, you should add it to
the LDFLAGS variable.  For example, if your shell is csh:

        setenv LIBGPLUSPLUS /usr/local/gcc-lib
        setenv LDFLAGS -L$HOME/lib
        setenv CC gcc
        setenv CXX g++
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME

or if your shell is a variant of sh (if your shell does not fall into
the category of "things that suck"):

        LIBGPLUSPLUS=$HOME/lib LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib CC=gcc CXX=g++ \
          ./configure --prefix=$HOME

If you get a warning from `configure' to the effect that ``The DIFF
command SOMEDIR/diff is not version 2.7,'' and you do, in fact, have
the necessary version of diff installed under some other name or in
some other directory, set the environment variable
SYS_GDIFF_COMMAND_PATH to the full pathname of the correct version
before re-running `configure'.  Similarly, you can use the variables
SYS_CI_COMMAND_PATH, SYS_CO_COMMAND_PATH, SYS_GDIFF3_COMMAND_PATH,
SYS_GZIP_COMMAND_PATH, SYS_LS_COMMAND_PATH, SYS_RCS_COMMAND_PATH,
SYS_RLOG_COMMAND_PATH, and SYS_TAR_COMMAND_PATH as needed to indicate
the locations of commands `ci', `co', `diff3', `gzip', `ls', `rcs',
`rlog', and `tar', if `configure' reports that these are missing or of
inappropriate version.

You may wish to supply several the additonal configure enable/disable
options:

        --disable-mmap  turns off all uses (and compilation of) mmap.
        --enable-debug  useful if you will be debugging PRCS.

Further, PRCS takes compile-time defaults for the various documented
environment variables when configure is run.  If set, each value is
used as a default when the users's environment does not have the
variable set.  The builder should take care that these settings are
appropriate for all users of the binary, or leave them unset at
compile-time.  'configure' prints out the variables it has detected.

4. Running the First Time.

Read at least the first several sections of the documentation.  It is
available from http://prcs.sourceforge.net or in the info files contained
in the source distribution.  Set your environment varaible
PRCS_REPOSITORY to the location you would like PRCS to use.  This
directory will be created the first time you run PRCS, if it doesn't
already exist.  You probably want to set several other environment
variables, a complete list is contained at the end of the
documentation.
